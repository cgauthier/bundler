#Bundler Examples

## Folders
- example
This folder contains a barebone example in creating a homemade JS bundler.
In this example we do demonstrate how to create an Abstract Syntax Tree using Babel/parser (formally Babylon)
We are using Babel 7.9.0 in this sample as you can determine from the content of package.json

###
Initial Commit
Goal: get node to run bundler.js so that we can output an AST tree using babelParser.
